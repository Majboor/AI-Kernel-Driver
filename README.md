# AI-Enhanced Kernel Monitoring

## Overview

This project integrates kernel-level driver development with advanced AI models to monitor and predict system anomalies. By focusing on reducing hallucinations in LLM outputs, we aim to create a reliable system monitoring tool that leverages the latest advancements in AI.

## Directory Structure

- **kernel_driver/**: Contains the kernel driver source code and documentation.
- **llm_research/**: Houses data, models, and research notebooks focused on LLM hallucination.
- **ai_innovations/**: Includes new AI algorithms and testing modules.
- **scripts/**: Utility scripts for setup, deployment, and maintenance.

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the desired module directory.
2. Follow the specific module instructions in their respective README files.
